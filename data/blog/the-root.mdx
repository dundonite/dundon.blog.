I feel like blogs are supposed to have names, no?
[Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/) is a classic of course.
[Techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/) was an old favorite of mine, though it appears they call themselves a newsletter.
Well it's also kind of confusing to give something _two_ names, and it does already have a pretty perfect domain name, IMHO.
But I was happy to see that all the tools I'm using to build and test this site will render a tailing dot!
And you know what that means, of course.
Right?
That's right!
It means I get to name the site "Dundon.Blog." and it's actually consistent!
It's so hard to find a unique, information-rich domain name these days.
And it's so rare to find a good technical shibboleth that can be so subtely used in a public place.

At the bottom of it all, the last turtle stands on the [root zone](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files).
