It's a blog, much like all the others. 

Today I'm building this blog with NextJS and Markdown, using one of the many example sites out there. I had a few requirements:

1. Simple to get started with minimal complexity, but flexible enough that migration should be unecessary.
I don't want to become a NextJS expert, I need tested solutions with ample resources available.
1. The ability to write content in markdown out-of-the box.
I love markdown for editing and would prefer it over a visual editor for most tasks.
Plus, it helps to facilitate...
1. Static site building.
I don't want to pay for hosting, this needs to run on GH Pages or similar.
For now it's running on GH Pages, because why not let Microsoft run the world?

I'm not really a React or Node guy, but I figure there are enough resources out there that if I run into an issue I'll be able to find what I need.
Or just have some LLM do it for me.
